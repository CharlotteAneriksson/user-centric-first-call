        <h3>Differens between text-editor, code-editor and IDE</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Texteditor</strong> simply writes text, ex. notepad. No help, not any built in stuff that colors your code or no code snippets, no nothing. You can use it to learn, absolutly but i would recommend a code editor. </li>
            <li><strong>Code editor</strong> is designed special to write code for programs. It colors your code nicely which makes it more readable. This type helps you to focus and really learn the code, not any advanced stuff like autocomplete which acually can make your learning process longer since your not typing the code yourself. </li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong>, IDE i a more advanced editor that will save you alot of time while writing code. It has extensions like codesnippets, live-server, autocomplete and alot more. This might take the focus of the codeing language away do to the fact theres alot to learn in the IDE itself. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Online or Offline editors?</h3>

    <div
        ><h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <h5>IDE</h5>
        <p>Open source IDE created by Microsoft for windows, linus and Mac.<br />
            Supports alot of different languages, debugging, embedded Git and GitHub, syntax highlights and great code completion.<br />
            Allow user to change themes, make your own settings for keyboard shortcuts and allow you to download a bunch of extensions.<br />
        </p>
        <p>In may 2019 they released the online version, I havent tried it yet but i would like to.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Sublime</h3>
        <h5>Code-editor</h5>
        <p>Free software licensed code editor with a Python API. Supports alot of languages too and colors your code real nice. Makes it easier to learn and understand the syntax.
            <br />If you need any functions you need to use plugins. Great to start with, great offline editor and its super easy to set up.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Atom</h3>
        <h5>Code-editor and IDE</h5>
        <p>This editor has both an offline and an online IDE. They have plugins written in Node.js and also embedded Git Control.<br />
        Never tried but I hear it is awesome.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Gitpod</h3>
        <h5>Online IDE</h5>
        <p>Free open source but only up to 100h /month which acually is pretty much depending on how they count the time.</p>
        <p>Just heard about this one, i know a few students use it. As GitHub say themself, One-click ready-to-code development enviroment for github. Saves alot of time with deploying and pushing to github apparently. </p>

            <h3>What do you perfer?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What or which once have you tried?</li>
                <li>What do you like about them?</li>
                <li>Do you feel safe in this jungel?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What i perfer and why..</h3>
            <p>When I first tryied code, i mean for the first time ever I acually used notepad++, then after som experience (like two days haha) and some googleing, yeah you know, I moved up to Sublime.</p>
            <p>Then when I really started to learn in this course and got sick of my bad internet connection i used VS Code more then Cloud 9 and I fell in love. And its really easy to download and they help you to get going.</p>
            <p>Visual Studio Code has everything i need and more, there are so many features that I dont even know about. What i love the most is live server and all code snippet extensions.</p>
            <p>There are some cons too ofcourse, as you get used to the snippets and autocomplete you might forget some stuff sometimes.</p>
